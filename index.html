Another year, another birthday and I know that you're scared that you're getting old but at least you're getting old with me right? Yet somehow I still can‚Äôt find the right words to tell you what you mean to me.

We‚Äôve been through so much together. The laughs that made my stomach hurt, the quiet moments that spoke louder than words, the nights we talked about everything and nothing. You‚Äôve seen me at my best, but more importantly, you‚Äôve stayed when I was at my worst. That‚Äôs not something I take lightly. That‚Äôs rare. That‚Äôs you.

I don‚Äôt know what the future looks like exactly, but I know this ‚Äî I want you in it. I want more adventures, more stupid inside jokes, more shared silences that somehow feel like home. Life hits hard sometimes, but with you around, it feels softer. Safer.

So on your birthday, I just want to say: thank you. For being here. For being you. For making the world ‚Äî my world ‚Äî better just by existing in it. Happy birthday, So. I hope this year brings you peace, clarity, love ‚Äî and maybe even a little bit of the magic you‚Äôve given me.

With all my heart,
‚Äî ur Dearest Levi again`;
